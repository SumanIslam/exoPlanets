## Introduction
This project is about information of exploring space, planets beyond our solar system. Finding those planets that are most likely to be habitable that means planets that human
can one day live on. I have done this using Node.js. The story starts with the Kepler space telescope launched into space in 2009. For nearly 10 years it looked out into space and
gathered data about planets beyond our solar system. Kepler observed hundreds of thousands of stars and in doing so, helped us discover over 4000 planets and the best part is NASA 
shared all the data that Kepler gathered over the time.

Details of Liftoff of the Kepler spacecraft is available [here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/launch/index.html).

We got all the data that kepler telescope gathered all the year from [NASA Exoplanets Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html) and all the data are stored in **kepler_data.csv** file in the current project directory.

What the hell is exoplanets?
> An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system.
